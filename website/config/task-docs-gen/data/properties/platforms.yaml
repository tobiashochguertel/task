short: Operating systems where task can run.

  Restrict task or command execution to specific platforms (OS and/or architecture). Uses Go's GOOS and GOARCH values. On a platform mismatch, the task or command is skipped without error.
  
  Can specify OS only (e.g., windows), architecture only (e.g., amd64), or both (e.g., windows/amd64). Multiple platforms can be specified.
contexts:
  - Task level
  - Command level
