name: deps
type: "[]Dependency"
short: Task dependencies that run before this task.
description: |
  Define tasks that must run before the current task. Dependencies run in parallel by default, making builds faster. If tasks need to run serially, use task calls in cmds instead.
  
  A task can have only dependencies and no commands to group tasks together. Dependencies of a task should not depend on each other since they run concurrently.
