short: Output files generated by this task.
description: |
  Glob patterns for output files produced by the task. Used together with sources to enable Task's incremental build feature. Task compares source and generated file checksums (or timestamps) to determine if task execution is necessary.
  
  When both sources and generates are specified, Task will skip execution if all source files are older than (or have same checksum as when) generated files were created.
