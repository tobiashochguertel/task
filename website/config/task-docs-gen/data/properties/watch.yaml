name: watch
type: boolean
short: Enable watch mode for continuous execution.
description: |
  When set to true, the task automatically runs in watch mode, monitoring source files and re-executing on changes. Requires the sources attribute to be defined. Only runs in watch mode when invoked directly from CLI, not when called as a dependency.
  
  The default watch interval is 100ms, but can be customized globally with interval setting or --interval flag. The interval is the debounce time - Task waits this long for duplicate events and only runs once.
