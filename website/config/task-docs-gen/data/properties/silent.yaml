name: silent
type: boolean
short: Suppress command echo before execution.
description: |
  Disable echoing of commands before Task runs them. When enabled, only the command output is shown, not the command itself. There are four ways to enable silent mode: at command level, task level, globally at Taskfile level, or with the --silent/-s flag.
  
  Silent mode only suppresses command echoing. To suppress STDOUT, redirect output to /dev/null in the command itself.
contexts:
  - Taskfile (root level)
  - Task level
  - Command level
