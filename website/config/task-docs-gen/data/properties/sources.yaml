  Glob patterns for input files that Task monitors to determine if a task needs to run. Task compares checksums (or timestamps with method: timestamp) of source files against generated files. If sources haven't changed, Task skips execution and shows "Task is up to date".
  
  Use exclude: to ignore specific files from patterns. Sources are evaluated in order, so exclude must come after the positive glob it negates.
